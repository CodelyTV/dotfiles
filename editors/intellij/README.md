# Code Templates
Those files are not shared via JetBrains account, so I have to put it here.

Files can be obtained from:
`~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea{version}/fileTemplates`

With the [`add_code_templates`](../../scripts/intellij/add_code_templates) script you can create the symlink.
This should be executed after updating intellij to a new major version.
