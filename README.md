Repository containing all the automations required to setup your MacOS in just a feww seconds afrter a fresh install.

Feel free to explore the repository and get anything you need ðŸ˜¬

## Instructions

1. Read the `Contents` section of this readme in order to grasp which kind of settings and tools it provides
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/CodelyTV/dotfiles.git codelytv_dotfiles`
2. Move to the project root directory: `cd codelytv_dotfiles`
3. Modify the scripts in order to suite your needs
4. Execute the scripts from the terminal:
    * `.install_macos_apps.sh`
    * `.adjust_macos_settings.sh`

## Contents

You'll find some self-explanatory files in this repo containing comments on what they do, however, here you have a brief explanation of each on of them.

### `install_macos_apps.sh`

This script will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). It's a package manager for MacOS, used to install some tools like `htop`, `ffmpeg`, `git`, `php`â€¦ you get the idea, Command Line Tools, programming languages, and so on. 

Homebrew also includes [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/). It's a package manager useful to install fully functional OS X applications such as `google-chrome`, `spotify`, `slack`â€¦

With these 2 command line tools, we'll be able to install and upgrade our apps without having to leave the terminal. This allow us to automate the whole setup process while starting clean on a new mac, and also to do not have to open all the different apps we've installed in order to update them.

You can [check out the `install_macos_apps.sh` script](install_macos_apps.sh) in order to see the detailed list of the apps it will install, and modify it based on your needs, and [the available packages in Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) and [Homebrew Cask apps](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/tree/master/Casks).

### `adjust_macos_settings.sh`

This script will modify system preferences. We would recommend you to [take a look at the `adjust_macos_settings.sh` script](adjust_macos_settings.sh) in order to know the actual list of aspects it will modify. Here you have a brief list of them:

* Dock: Automatically hide the dock with a fewer delay and animation times
* Mission Control: Add Hot corners behaviour and reduce the animation time
* Keyboard: Reduce the delay for repeating a key while pressed, and the time between repetitions of that key
* Mouse: Increase its speed
* Trackpad: Enable tap to click for the current user and for the login screen. (Don't have to press down on the trackpad -- just tap it.)
* Finder: Disable animations + show extensions + set columns as default view + show pathbar + enable [spring-loading directories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9kdAxGe9SE)â€¦
* Safari & WebKit: Allow hitting the Backspace key to go to the previous page + show full URL + disable automatic spelling correctionsâ€¦
* Others: Disable the sound effects on boot + always show scrollbars + disable automatic capitalization + Avoid creating .DS_Store files on network or USB volumes + Maximize windows with `Ctrl+alt+Cmd+f`â€¦

## Work In Progress

As you can see, right now this repository only consists of these two simply files. The idea is to add new settings to it during my own setup process, and allow you to contribute to it ðŸ™‚
